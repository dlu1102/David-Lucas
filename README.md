## ðŸ“‚ Featured Projects

### Project #4 â€“ Credential Access Detection Playbook (Splunk + MITRE ATT&CK)  
- Built Splunk queries and dashboards to **detect SSH authentication anomalies**.  
- Applied **risk scoring** to prioritize attacker IPs.  
- Created an alert mapped to **MITRE ATT&CK T1110 (Credential Access)**.  
- Structured as a **SOC playbook**: detect â†’ correlate â†’ prioritize â†’ escalate â†’ respond.

### Project #3 â€“ Python Log Parsing & SSH Login Analysis  
- Scripted simulated login attempts (success/fail) and parsed logs.  
- Extracted attacker IPs and summarized brute-force activity.  
- Overcame Windows/Linux path errors and regex parsing challenges.
